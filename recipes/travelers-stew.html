        <h1> Traveler's Stew</h1>
        <img CLASS = "stew" src="https://i.redd.it/t3zw50b9qvy51.jpg">
        <p>Straight out of a Dungeons & Dragons cookbook, this stew is an instant classic for a cold day.</p>
           
        <div><h3>Igredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 1/2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil - I like using rapeseed oil because of its higher smoking point.</li>
                <li>1 cup dark beer</li>
                <li>4 cups beef stock</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
                <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
                <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes (standard baking potatoes work too), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul></div>
            </ul>
        </br>
        </br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt (I used garlic salt because I love garlic), and several grinds of pepper. Add the beef and toss to coat well.</li>
                <li>Warm the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook for about 5 minutes, turning to brown all sides evenly. The recipe says to do a little of the meat at a time in batches, to be sure not to overcrowd the pot, but I was impatient and just did it all at once. I kept a close eye on it and it turned out fine. Just had to stir more often.</li>
                <li>Take all the meat out of the pot. Return the browned beef to the pot, and add the broth & paprika.</li>
                <li>Adjust the heat to low, cover and cook at a simmer until the meat is very tender (typically 1.5-2 hours.)</li>
                <li>Add the onions, carrots and potatoes to the pot. Continue to simmer untilthe vegerables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the parsely and season with salt & pepper as needed. Serve hot, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
