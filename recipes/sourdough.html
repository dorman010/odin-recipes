<p>A good loaf of sourdough bread is one of the most precies forms of baking, and I've grown to love it over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>I recommend using a <a href = "https://foodgeek.dk/en/bread-calculator">sourdough calculator</a> to make sure you measure everything accurately. What you'll need:</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Strong white bread flour (at least 12% protein): 450g</li>
    <li>Salt: 10g</li>
    <li>Water: 300g</li>
    <li>Sourdough starter: 100g (at 100% hydration)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure you feed your starter the day before you start this process so it's active and hungry the next day</li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix the water with the starter and salt. Gradually add in the flour and mix until it gets fully incorporated.</li>
    <li>Let rest in a covered container for 8-9 hours.</li>
    <li>Remove dough from container onto a floured surface. Work into shape of basket, leave for 10 minutes to ensure it retains its shape. Afterwards, put into basket and let it proof overnight.</li>
    <li>The next morning, pre-heat oven to 230 degrees C. Once the oven is hot, remove the dough from the fridge. Put onto e.g. a cast iron casserole dish, score the bread diagonally, and insert (covered) into the oven for 45 minutes. Rmove cover after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Oce your bread is done, let it cool on a rack of some sort for an hour before slicing in - resist the temptation to have some immediately, as the bread is still cooking on the inside!</li>
